SecureShare is a decentralized file sharing application based on blockchain technology. It allows users to securely upload, download, and share files within a small network, ensuring resource availability, chain validity, and access control mechanisms.

How It Works 🔧
SecureShare uses blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and secure way of sharing files. Users can upload files to the blockchain network, which ensures the authenticity and validity of the file. The blockchain network also ensures that the file is always available, even if some nodes go offline.

To download a file, a user must have the correct access permissions. Access permissions are granted by the owner of the file and recorded on the blockchain network. The owner can also revoke access permissions at any time.

Users can share files with other users on the network by granting them access permissions. This allows multiple users to collaborate on a file without compromising its security.
